Please be advised that due to various limitations and constraints, the card artwork in the current version of the game is temporary in nature. We acknowledge that these visual assets may not meet the standards we aspire to achieve.
We want to assure our players that improving the game's artistic quality is a priority for our development team. Should resources and capabilities allow in the future, we are committed to enhancing and replacing the current card artwork with higher-quality assets.
We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to develop and improve the gaming experience. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we work toward delivering the best possible product.
Thank you for your continued support.
